            <p class="intro">
                I grew up in a small village about an hour from Lisbon. My mind never stayed still â€” I tried it all: competitive swimming, basketball, skateboarding, gaming, and drawing. That curiosity and creativity eventually led me to visual arts, which became the foundation of my career in design and product.
            </p>
            <p class="intro">
                I had a happy childhood, and later spent several years abroad in Belgium and the Netherlands. That time away made me deeply value Portugal â€” not only as a home but as a place where I can give back, invest in my community, and share what I've learned along the way.
            </p>
            <p class="intro">
                Today, I live with my partner of five years. We recently bought our first home, and we're having a lot of fun (and work) designing every detail together. I'm happiest when I'm cooking for friends, traveling, or just enjoying simple moments.

                    I'm deeply passionate about product, design, and psychology. For me, product management is about constantly questioning assumptions, looking at problems from different angles, and finding simple, effective solutions.
