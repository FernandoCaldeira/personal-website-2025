        Fernando Caldeira — Product Manager leveraging design to scale global products with delight.
    </h1>
    
    <p class="intro-text">
        From driving monetization at Ablo to spearheading innovation at Tinder, I build products that millions of people love to use. I believe great product management is the art of balancing design empathy with data-driven execution. Based in Portugal, collaborating with distributed teams worldwide.
    </p>

    <p class="intro-text">
        I’m at my best when bridging the gap between technical complexity and user simplicity. I don’t just manage roadmaps; I foster a culture where engineering and design work in sync to solve the right problems — not just the easiest ones.
    </p>

    <p class="intro-text">
        Beyond the roadmap, I'm currently obsessed with three frontiers: identifying sustainable AI value that survives the hype at a global scale, leveraging AI to shift the PM role from execution to pure strategy, and building hyper-local tools to drive regional development back home.

            <p class="job-description">
                Working within Tinder’s Innovation Lab, I lead cross-functional teams that operate like an internal product studio. We own "Big Bets" from A to Z, spearheading game-changing features across Chat, Profile, and Discovery. Once we find product-market fit and scale the initial impact, we transition ownership to core teams for long-term optimization.
            </p>

            <ul class="achievements">
                <li><strong>Tackling Gen Z Engagement:</strong> Spearheaded the "Double Date" initiative and new discovery frameworks to reverse declining usage trends, focusing on shared experiences rather than just swiping.</li>
                <li><strong>Scaling Premium Value (Tinder SELECT):</strong> Orchestrated product enhancements for the high-end segment, directly increasing retention and premium revenue through targeted, high-touch user experiences.</li>
                <li><strong>High-Impact Feature Validation:</strong> Focused on rapid experimentation to identify sustainable engagement drivers, successfully scaling innovations that were later integrated into the core product ecosystem.</li>
                <li><strong>Design-Led Profile Optimization:</strong> Launched a suite of profile features that led to record photo uploads and discovery depth.</li>
                <li><strong>Retention Uplift:</strong> Improved conversation depth and active days—particularly among female users—by shipping features that prioritize meaningful connection over volume.</li>
                <li><strong>Trusted Execution:</strong> Maintained role through layoffs—delivering confidence and consistent results.</li>

                Ablo connected people worldwide with real-time chat, video, and live translations. It was named Google App of the Year in its first year. I was responsible for transforming a viral sensation (50M+ users) into a sustainable business, ensuring that revenue growth never compromised the "magic" of serendipitous global connection.
            </p>

            <ul class="achievements">
                <li><strong>Aggressive Monetization Strategy:</strong> Engineered a new revenue roadmap that delivered a 300% increase in quarterly revenue. I achieved this by balancing new subscription tiers with gamified micro-transactions.</li>
                <li><strong>Strategic Feature Pruning:</strong> To sharpen retention, I proposed and executed the removal of low-value legacy features, reallocating resources to a new streaming vertical that drove higher user LTV (Lifetime Value).</li>
                <li><strong>Scale from Zero to 50M:</strong> Navigated the challenges of hyper-growth, working closely with data teams to identify and double down on the core features that moved Ablo from a niche tool to a global platform. During my stay I've created +150 specs.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="job-description">
                This role gave me my first managerial responsibilities and shaped how I approach problem framing, solution design, and data analysis/impact measurement.
